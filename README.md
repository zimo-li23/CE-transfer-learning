# CE-transfer-learning
We propose a deep learning framework that combines transfer learning with cluster expansion method for accurately predicting the physical properties of high-entropy alloys. The cluster expansion method establishes a physical model of the alloy system using the original data, while the transfer learning model extracts important physical information from the data generated by cluster expansion for prediction. When applied to the FeNiCoCrMn/Pd high-entropy alloy systems, the framework shows significant enhancement in the prediction accuracy of formation energy and atomic magnetic moment. The transfer learning model maintains good prediction performance even at the small dataset limit. The proposed framework combines the efficient data utilization of transfer learning with the clear physical insights of cluster expansion, augmenting the predictive capability of machine learning on small datasets.
